## Adaptive Model Selection Framework

### Overview
This module provides an intelligent framework for dynamically selecting the most appropriate AI model based on task characteristics and historical performance.

### Key Features
- ü§ñ Dynamic Model Selection
- üìä Performance-Based Routing
- üîç Task Complexity Analysis
- üìà Performance Visualization

### Components
1. **Adaptive Model Selector**
   - Evaluates models across multiple dimensions
   - Considers response time, token efficiency, success rate
   - Adapts to task complexity

2. **Performance Tracking**
   - SQLite-based historical performance logging
   - Continuous model performance assessment

3. **Visualization Tools**
   - Interactive Plotly dashboards
   - Model performance comparisons

### Usage Example
```python
from adaptive_model_router import AdaptiveModelSelector

selector = AdaptiveModelSelector()
recommended_model = selector.select_optimal_model(
    "Generate technical documentation", 
    complexity="medium"
)
```

### Performance Metrics
- Response Time
- Token Generation Rate
- Task Success Rate
- Error Rate

### Future Roadmap
- Machine learning prediction of model performance
- More granular task complexity analysis
- Integration with real-time API performance data

### Ethical Considerations
- Transparent model selection
- Avoid algorithmic bias
- Maintain model diversity
